/*
 * üî∑ Factory Design Pattern (Factory Method Pattern)
‚úÖ Definition
The Factory Pattern defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

It helps encapsulate object creation logic, promoting loose coupling.

üîë Key Intent
‚ÄúCreate objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refer to the newly created object using a common interface.‚Äù

‚úÖ When to Use Factory Pattern?
When you don‚Äôt know the exact class of object to create.

When object creation logic is complex or based on conditions.

To avoid tight coupling between client code and specific classes.

When you want to follow Open/Closed Principle (O from SOLID).

üß± Components
Product (Interface / Abstract Class)

Concrete Products (Subclasses)

Creator / Factory Class (with the method that returns objects)
